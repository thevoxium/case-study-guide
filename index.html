                                        <li><strong>Market Penetration Pricing:</strong> Low initial price to gain market share quickly, build volume, create network effects, and deter competition. (Often used for mass-market products or when experience curve effects are significant).</li>

                    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Briefly summarize the 2-4 most critical root causes, key insights, or pivotal conclusions from your analysis that directly lead to your recommendations. Be concise, logical, and impactful.</p>
                    <p><em>Example for Profitability: "Based on our analysis, the client's 15% profit decline is primarily driven by three key factors: first, a 10% increase in the cost of raw materials due to reduced supplier competition and inflationary pressures; second, a 5% decrease in sales volume in our largest customer segment, likely due to a new competitor's aggressive pricing; and third, an inefficient marketing spend in digital channels showing a declining ROI over the past year."</em></p>
                    <p><em>Example for Market Entry: "Our assessment indicates that while the target market is large and growing at 8% annually, the competitive landscape is highly fragmented with intense price competition, and our client currently lacks a key distribution channel critical for success in this market. Furthermore, the required upfront investment of $50M carries a significant risk given the uncertain path to profitability."</em></p>

                    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Propose specific, actionable, and prioritized solutions that directly address the identified root causes (or capitalize on opportunities) and help achieve the client's objective. Your recommendations should be the logical outcome of your analysis.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Be Specific & Actionable:</strong> Clearly state WHAT needs to be done. Avoid vague suggestions like "improve marketing." Instead, "Revamp the digital marketing strategy by reallocating 30% of the budget from display ads to targeted social media campaigns focused on segment X, and implement A/B testing for ad copy."</li>
                        <li><strong>Address Root Causes Directly:</strong> Ensure each recommendation directly tackles one or more of the core issues or opportunities identified in your synthesis.</li>
                        <li><strong>Prioritize:</strong> If multiple recommendations, suggest an order or categorize them (e.g., short-term vs. long-term, by strategic pillar, quick wins vs. major initiatives). Explain the rationale for prioritization (e.g., based on impact, feasibility, urgency).
                            <em>"I recommend a three-pronged approach. First, for immediate impact within the next quarter, we should focus on [Quick Win]. Second, over the next 6-12 months, we need to [Medium-Term Initiative]. Finally, for long-term sustainable improvement, we should invest in [Long-Term Strategic Change]."</em>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Justify Your Recommendations:</strong> Briefly explain the rationale (the "WHY") behind each recommendation, linking it back to your findings and analysis.
                            <em>"To address the rising material costs, I recommend initiating a strategic sourcing program to identify and qualify alternative suppliers and to renegotiate terms with current key suppliers. This is expected to reduce material costs by 5-7% based on preliminary benchmarks."</em>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Consider Quantifiable Impact (where possible/credible):</strong> e.g., "This could lead to a 5-8% increase in revenue within 12 months," or "This initiative is projected to reduce operational costs by approximately $2M annually." Acknowledge if these are high-level estimates requiring further validation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Make them SMART (where applicable):</strong> Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound (or at least with a clear sense of timing).</li>
                        <li><strong>Holistic View:</strong> Ensure recommendations are consistent with each other and with the client's overall strategy and constraints.</li>
